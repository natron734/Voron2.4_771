# Voron2.4_771
This is my setup.

These are my current, as of last upload (date indicated next to file) of 
configurations for my Voron 2.4 r2 with modifications.

Some of these are:

    Octopus 1.0 + onboard CANBUS
    EBB36 CANBUS
    Galileo 2
    Stealthburner +LEDs
    Chamber Temp sensor
    Exhaust fan temp control
    TAP
    Sensorless homing XY

Use these configs at your own risk and only after confirming (diff!)

following my progress too closely will most certainly result in you 
dealing with the same problems I have seen.

If you persist, you do so at your own risk and also in my rewards.

In tuning and modification of my Voron, I have learned many things that I
wish to pass on.

Receive them with my blessing.

My hope is that the reader (you) come to know the Most High, Lord of All.
John 3:16 is true, and it is for everyone who bears his mark of creation.
